## Developers Story
Create an app that allows users to search for books.
Users must sign-up or login to begin searching or pinning books.
User authorization is required upon logging in.
Users should have the ability to edit their profile at any time.
Users should be able to search by author, title, or genre.
Displayed book information should include book image, title, author(s), ISBN, summary/description, and a preview-link.
If some portion of the book information is not available, user should see a placeholder.
After searching for books, users can pin books to favorites.
Users can remove books from the favorites page.
As a bonus, users that dwell on the home page will be entertained with a random joke.
Users and pinned books are saved to database.
User profile edits as well as edits to the favorite page are automatically reflected in the database.
